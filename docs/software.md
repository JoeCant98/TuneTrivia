Creating a mobile app and a main app for TuneTrivia involves both mobile and desktop development. Here are some suggestions for software tools and frameworks you could use:

### Mobile App (Web App):

1. **Frontend Framework: React Native or Flutter**
   - **React Native:** Developed by Facebook, React Native allows you to build cross-platform mobile apps using JavaScript and React.
   - **Flutter:** Developed by Google, Flutter uses the Dart programming language and provides a rich set of pre-designed widgets for creating attractive UIs.

2. **Web Development: React or Angular**
   - If you choose React Native, familiarity with React for the web can be beneficial.

### Main App (Desktop):

1. **Electron**
   - Electron allows you to build cross-platform desktop applications using web technologies (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript). It's a popular choice for creating desktop apps with web technologies.

2. **Frontend Framework: React or Angular**
   - If you're using Electron, you can leverage the same frontend framework you used for the mobile app for consistency.

3. **Backend Framework: Node.js with Express, Django, Flask, or similar**
   - For the backend, you'll need a server to handle game logic, user authentication, and communication between the mobile app and the main app.

### Communication between Mobile and Desktop:

1. **WebSockets or Socket.io**
   - To enable real-time communication between the mobile app and the main app, consider using WebSockets or a library like Socket.io.

### Code Editors:

1. **Visual Studio Code, Atom, Sublime Text**
   - Choose a code editor that you are comfortable with for writing and managing your code.

### Version Control:

1. **Git and GitHub (or GitLab, Bitbucket)**
   - Use Git for version control, and consider hosting your code on GitHub or a similar platform for collaboration.

### Database:

1. **MongoDB, PostgreSQL, MySQL**
   - Choose a database that suits your data storage needs.

### Deployment:

1. **Heroku, Netlify (for the mobile app)**
   - These platforms make it easy to deploy and host your web applications.

2. **Electron Builder (for the main app)**
   - Electron Builder can package your Electron app for distribution on different operating systems.

### Additional Tools:

1. **Postman or Insomnia**
   - These tools can help you test API endpoints during development.

2. **Swagger/OpenAPI**
   - If your API becomes more complex, consider using Swagger or OpenAPI for API documentation.

Remember that the choice of tools often depends on your personal preferences, team expertise, and the specific requirements of your project. Additionally, technology landscapes can change, so it's always a good idea to check for the latest recommendations and updates.
